# Sentiment_Analysis
Natural Language Processing

- Objective of this project was to apply basic natural language processing to understand sentiment of population towards a given variable. 

- Twitter API was used to collect 1000 tweets. 

- This project was built in Python using Google Colab. 

- Tweets were collected in pandas data frame in realtime for ease of view. 

- Tweets were pre-processed to remove handles, urls, special characters, numbers, punctuations, short words and letter case was normalized. 

- Tweets were tokenized to remove collection words and stop words, and perform lemmatization to groups variants of the same word into one root word. 

- Bar graphs were used to visualize frequency of single words and bigram chart was used to visualize frequency of co-occurring words. 

- Tweets were untokenized to produce clean tweets. These were used to create word cloud to easily spot word frequencies. 

- Text Blob was used assign polarity values to clean tweets. Polarity values were visualized using histograms. 

- Alternative method of analyzing sentiment was used by using bar graphs to plot frequency of hashtags.
